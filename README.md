# What is this?

I made this project as a bit of a joke between some of my friends. In essence the goal was to try to capture some of the out of pocket comments that are made by my one friend. This repo takes about a years worth of groupchat messages isolates his responses to comments and uses them to finetune a GPT2 model.
